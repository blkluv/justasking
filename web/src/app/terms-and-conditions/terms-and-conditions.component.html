          DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                   
          <br>
          Informal Negotiations
          To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each
          a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the
          “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided
          below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
          written notice from one Party to the other Party.
                   
          <br>
          Binding Arbitration
          If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes
          expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
          WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
          The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
          Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer
          Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your
          arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
          where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the
          submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a
          statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award
          may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or
          applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Broward County,FL. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties
          may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
          enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.
          If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted
          in the state and federal courts located in Broward County,FL, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all
          defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such
          state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
          Goods and the the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
          In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one
          (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party
          will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and
          such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and
          the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
          
          <br>
          Restrictions
          The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full
          extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority
          for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right
          or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or
          any other persons.
          Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
          The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
          negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any
          of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
          invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal
          or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
          found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the
          courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

            remarketing services on the Site through the use of first party cookies and third-party cookies, to, among other
            things, analyze and track users’ use of the Site, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand
  
            online activity. By accessing the Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party
            vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your
            questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors. However, If you do not want any
            information to be collected and used by tracking technologies, you can visit the third-party vendor or Network
            Advertising Initiative Opt-Out Tool or Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Tool.
            You should be aware that getting a new computer, installing a new browser, upgrading an existing browser, or
            erasing or otherwise altering your browser’s cookies files may also clear certain opt-out cookies, plug-ins, or
            settings.
            THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES
            The Site may contain links to third-party websites and applications of interest, including advertisements and external
            services, that are not affiliated with us. Once you have used these links to leave the Site, any information you
            provide to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Policy, and we cannot guarantee the safety and privacy
            of your information. Before visiting and providing any information to any third-party websites, you should inform
            yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take
            those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect the privacy of your information. We are not responsible for the
            content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other sites, services or
            applications that may be linked to or from the Site.
            SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
            We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While
            we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite
            our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be
            guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. Any information disclosed online is vulnerable to
            interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee complete security if you provide
            personal information.
            POLICY FOR CHILDREN
            We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If you become aware of any
            data we have collected from children under age 13, please contact us using the contact information provided below.
            CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
            activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
            collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
            communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
            in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.
